# M025: architecture decision laboratory

[Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md) · [Repository overview](../README.md)

Architecture at this scale means assigning responsibilities and avoiding unnecessary synchronization. You do not need a distributed system diagram to make a consequential design choice. A small function boundary, a stable identifier or one CSS owner can determine whether a later change stays understandable.

## Decision review 1: Save definitions rather than query results

**Reference rationale:** A saved view expresses how to select current data. Copying the current matching items into the view would freeze an accidental snapshot and miss later additions. The reference keeps item records and view definitions separate, then composes them during rendering. This is a different product from a historical snapshot, which would need its own name and contract.

**Question to resolve:** What user expectation distinguishes a saved filter from a saved report snapshot?

### Write competing proposals

Proposal A is the reference approach. Proposal B must be a plausible alternative, not an obviously broken straw man. Describe what each stores, what each derives, which boundary each validates and where visible feedback occurs. For a static page, describe source order, container/child ownership and content behavior instead of inventing application state.

### Use the same acceptance examples

Run both proposals against the same ordinary case, boundary and future-change scenario. If they produce different behavior, decide whether the difference is permitted by the contract. If both satisfy the contract, compare the number of facts a maintainer must keep synchronized and the amount of unrelated work needed for the next feature.

| Criterion | Reference proposal | Alternative proposal | Evidence needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Meets current user contract | Fill in | Fill in | One discriminating example |
| Owns each fact in one place | Fill in | Fill in | Source or state diagram |
| Handles failure or missing input | Fill in | Fill in | Error/recovery sequence |
| Supports the next small story | Fill in | Fill in | Proposed bounded diff |

### Record the decision with a reversal condition

Write: “I choose A/B because this concrete example shows this cost. I would revisit the choice if this specific requirement appeared.” A reversal condition prevents the decision from becoming a slogan. Do not use a hypothetical million-user future to justify complexity that teaches nothing about the present example.

**Source anchor:** `public/core.js` and `src/App.jsx`. Inspect the actual dependency direction; a diagram that names layers but cannot identify a call or data flow is incomplete.

## Decision review 2: Separate label from identity

**Reference rationale:** People may choose the same display name twice. The select menu includes IDs so duplicate labels remain distinguishable, and renameView looks up the stable ID. The reference favors visible full IDs for teaching clarity; a future product could present shorter disambiguators without replacing the underlying identity.

**Question to resolve:** Why would renaming a label be dangerous if the label were also the storage key?

## Decision review 3: Make broken references visible

**Reference rationale:** Removing a category can invalidate a definition even when its item records still exist. The reference keeps the definition and shows a warning with no results. This differs intentionally from M018's permissive URL fallback: a saved user definition should not silently broaden its meaning. The difference belongs in the contract.

**Question to resolve:** When would automatically converting the category to all surprise the user?

## A compact decision record you can copy

```text
Context and user need:
Current invariant:
Proposal A:
Proposal B:
Discriminating example:
Observed or predicted outcomes, clearly labeled:
Decision and reason:
Cost accepted:
Revisit when:
Verification still needed:
```

## Avoid accidental scope expansion

A new abstraction should answer a problem you can name in the current code or selected story. If the main benefit is that it looks more professional, ask what specific change becomes easier and what new concepts a junior now has to learn. Keep the reference small enough to trace.

## Transfer the review habit

Why should a saved view store a query instead of a stale copy of matching items?

Use that question to compare this project with its paired curriculum repository. Cite the actual source or guide you inspected; do not claim the other repository uses a pattern merely because its name sounds related. Your comparison may conclude that the shared learning concept appears in a different implementation.
